# cplanets
A simple orbital simulator written in C++, inspired by Yaron Minsky's "planets" program.

This project is a complete rewrite of another project (named [Japla](https://github.com/hydren/japla)) in C++, using SDL and SDL_widgets.

The application is in alpha stages, but it's fairly functional.
