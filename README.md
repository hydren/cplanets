# cplanets
A simple orbital simulator written in C++, inspired by Yaron Minsky's "planets" program.

This project is a complete rewrite of another project (named [Japla](https://github.com/hydren/japla)) in C++.

The project is still in pre-alpha stages. (Currently I'm doing tests with SDL and SDL_widgets)
