# cplanets
A simple orbital simulator written in C++, inspired by [Yaron Minsky's "planets" program](http://planets.homedns.org).

This project is a complete rewrite of another project (named [Japla](https://gitlab.com/hydren/japla)) in C++, using SDL and SDL_widgets.

See [BUILDING.md](https://gitlab.com/hydren/cplanets/blob/master/BUILDING.md) for information about building the code.
