# cplanets
A simple orbital simulator written in C++, inspired by [Yaron Minsky's "planets" program](http://planets.homedns.org).

This project is a complete rewrite of another project (named [Japla](https://github.com/hydren/japla)) in C++, using SDL and SDL_widgets.

The program is in beta quality, being fairly functional.
